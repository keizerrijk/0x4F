	Welcome to my site, here on the dark expansive internet. 
	<br>
	<br>
	I'm someone deeply interested in understanding, discussing, and thinking about the philosophical,
	and metaphysical aspects of modern life, and especially in regards to modern technology. 
	<br>
	<br> 
	I'm planning on using this site, as a way to both practice
    programming, and also, as a platform to vent out my ideas, and frustrations with what I consider to be a fatalistically destined society.

	From a young age I was never really particularly interested in this reality. I've always wanted something <em>more.</em> Do I have any clue what that
	is or means? Nope. All I know is that I've been searching for it for as long as I can remember. Will I ever find it? I'm not sure. But it's a damn good motivator. 
	<br>
	<br>
	I'm always on the hunt of new knowledge and new perspectives, even looking at myself a year ago is unrecognizable. Truthfully I believe it's just a never ending pursuit of novel stimulation, but I don't really thinks that's a bad thing.

	This site will be slowly filled with content. Starting with some essays I've written, and then more. 
	<br>
	<br>
	As a start though, here's a playlist I've been listening to while writing this:
