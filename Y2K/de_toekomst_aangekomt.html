      Imagine it, a beach with paradisal rolling computer generated waves, flowing like liquid mercury onto the digital sand lying ahead of you. An endless sea of 1s and 0s, flowing, contorting, shifting as information passes through it's infinite depths. Abstract shapes forming out of the ocean and melting away back into it just as quickly. The abstract geometric scenery is as beautiful as it is impossible.

      The new digital millennium is on the horizon. Technology is fresh, new, and exciting. The naive wonder at the new online world is unhampered by the storms of social unrest and mass data collection to come. The psychological effects of mass social media is still yet to be discovered.
