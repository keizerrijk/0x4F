  <h1>Welcome, to the digital ocean traveler.</h1>
  <br><br><br><br>

      Imagine it, a beach with paradisal rolling computer generated waves, flowing like liquid mercury onto the digital sand lying ahead of you. An endless sea of 1's and 0's, flowing, contorting, shifting as information passes through it's infinite depths. Abstract shapes forming out of the ocean and melting away back into it just as quickly.
      <br><br>
      Technology is fresh, new, and exciting. The naive wonder at the new digital world is unhampered by the storms of social unrest and mass data collection to come. The psychological effects of mass social media is still yet to be discovered.
      <br><br>
      Take a moment to place yourself in this state of mind.
      <br><br>
      I believe that often design aesthetics are a glimpse into the attitudes and state of mind that a time period had. Recently there has been more and more people looking into the design aesthetics (especially around early CGI) of the early 2000s. My impression at looking into this era of design, is as I described above, a time of naivety and futuristic positivity to the digital world of the future.
      <br><br>
      Contrasting it with the UI design of today, where a large amount of users have begun using dark themes; and flat design is rampant in it's virality, it shows a radical difference. A difference that I believe not only is indicative of a more cynical, darker, and insidious view of technology, but also around the culture of the use of technology.
      <br><br>
      The vast majority of technology today feels more like a devil's bargain than anything helpful or exciting. It provides benefit at the a painful cost. Use social media platforms and surrender yourself to invasive surveillance, but perhaps gain friends. Gain friends, but end up relying on digital communication as a crutch and become addicted to the internet.
      <br><br>
      I think now, more and more people; especially among the younger generations are at least subconsciously realizing this, and it shows in a clear cynicism among the zoomers especially in regards to digital life. We have shifted from a belief of a coming Digital Utopia, into a forboding vision of a Technological Dystopia.
      <br><br>
      I feel also that the overall tone of online communication has changed. Hatred of differing tribes within the digital space, the "e-girls" vs the "trad christians", the "redditors" vs the "instagrammers", etc... etc.. An endless turf war for an answer to the question of who is polluting and worsening the digital world. When the simple truth is, we have moved into the digital world, and for many, sadly myself included it has become in a sense more real than the physical world. It has become now that the internet is in a sense a cosmically intertwined alternate world for ourselves to escape to, and live in.
<br><br>
Perhaps looking at the designs of a happier, more humanistic and naive time gives me a temporary escape from the realities of Digitas Modernus
