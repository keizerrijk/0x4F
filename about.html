			<p1>
			I am. That's the only consistent thing that you can know about me. 
			<br>
			But, that's not a good description.
			<br><br>
			I enjoy learning new things, and playing around with systems. I also don't seem to very good at describing what it is I actually do.
			I am also a member of the Free Software Foundation and a member of a European Pirate Party.

			Privacy, and Anonymity is a big concern for me and I try to avoid the datanets as much as possible. In that aim I don't use networks such as Discord, Facebook, Instagram, or any of the other sinister data
			collection operations. My weaknesses in that regard tend to be 4chan, and Lainchan. 
			<br><br>
			Politically, at a point of time I would have considered myself to be on the right. These day I don't bother as much with that kind of thing. I support free expression, free information, non-invasive software,
			and free transparent society + governance.
