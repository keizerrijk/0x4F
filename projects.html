			<br>
			<p1>Listed down below is a bunch of projects that I'm currently working on\have completed. This site is one of these projects.</p1>
			<br><br>
			I'm surprised that I hadn't linked the repo here before, but the source code for this entire website can be found <b><a href="https://github.com/keizerrijk/0x4F">HERE</a></b>

				<b>/SUMMARY/</b>
			</div>
			I spent one night while very inspired, manically writing this as of yet incomplete story. It's
			plot and world is heavily inspired by the works of William Gibson, and the series Serial Experiments
			Lain. I'm not sure if I'll ever finish, as I've got a hard drive full of incomplete stories, but I
			hope I do.
			<br><br>
			You can download the .tex of the book from here: <a href="https://github.com/keizerrijk/Untitled-Cyberpunk-book">UNTITLED-CYBERPUNK-BOOK</a>
			<br><br>
			And you can download the pdf here: <a href="untitled.pdf">untitled.pdf</a>

			This project has been closed. 
			<br><br>
			This is the project that signalled the beginning of my interest in technology. I had some spare cash, and on a whim, I decided to register the domain name, zoomerchan.com.
			Having the name, I then had to figure out, with no knowledge of Linux, or web design in general, how to install imageboard software. I initially used vichan, but it ended up being utter garbage, and full of soykaf not working, later I learned that it had been abandoned. From a suggestion, I ended up deciding to install the Lynxchan imageboard engine, this was a really good decision, and thanks to im633's guide, I was able to get it working (relatively) smoothly.

			<div class="pBreaker"><b>/PHILOSOPHY/</b></div>
			<p3>
			<br>
			I wanted the site to be a platform for free, and hopefully quality discussion. This ended up failing due to a tiny userbase, a persistent troll, and my own dissatisfaction with the lack of quality content, or any content for that matter. I also simply became disillusioned with my previous political affiliation, and so in the end decided to close the site, and anything else related to it.
