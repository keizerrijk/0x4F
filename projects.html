			This project has been closed. 
			<br><br>
			This is the project that signalled the beginning of my interest in technology. I had some spare cash, and on a whim, I decided to register the domain name, zoomerchan.com.
			Having the name, I then had to figure out, with no knowledge of Linux, or web design in general, how to install imageboard software. I initially used vichan, but it ended up being utter garbage, and full of soykaf not working, later I learned that it had been abandoned. From a suggestion, I ended up deciding to install the Lynxchan imageboard engine, this was a really good decision, and thanks to im633's guide, I was able to get it working (relatively) smoothly.

			<div class="pBreaker"><b>/PHILOSOPHY/</b></div>
			<p3>
			<br>
			I wanted the site to be a platform for free, and hopefully quality discussion. This ended up failing due to a tiny userbase, a persistent troll, and my own dissatisfaction with the lack of quality content, or any content for that matter. I also simply became disillusioned with my previous political affiliation, and so in the end decided to close the site, and anything else related to it.
