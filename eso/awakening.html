        <b>INTRODUCTION</b>
      </div>
      <br>
      The Universe we know is larger than human comprehension allows. We see an infinitely small amount of it in our lives. All of human knowledge is a speck, a filter, created to explain what we perceive.
      <br><br>
      It is important during this section to remember how little we know, and that we, even as a species have
      very little claim to be able to define what is and isn't possible.

        <b>THE FIRST STEP: /DOCUMENT/</b>
      </div>
      <br>
      Many months ago I stumbled upon a declassified document, detailing an experiment done by the United States Department of the Army. The report detailed many things that would be denounced as pseudoscience or insanity.   Extra-sensory perception, contact with non-corporeal entities, foreknowledge, astral projection, travel to higher dimensions in states of extreme meditation. The report radically altered my worldview, and I began to dig deeper into the topics featured, in the meantime I also replicated the experiments myself, and the results were miraculous; however, I leave my personal experiences to a coming section. I'm going to link here the document, if you're open minded, and curious to find the truth for yourself, read the document.
