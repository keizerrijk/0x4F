		<p1>
		Bash aliases are commands that can be placed within your <b>.bashrc</b> or other bash configuration file such as <b>/etc/bashrc</b>; that can function as a shortcut 
		to other more verbose commands/group of commands.
		<br>
		Alias syntax may look somewhat verbose to the inexperienced users of UNIX/Unix-like operating systems, but after you write 1 or 2 it becomes simple.
		<br>
		<br>
		The syntax goes as such: <b>alias [name_of_alias]="[command]"</b>
		<br>
		For example I use the following alias to make sure that when I run <b>ls</b> it runs <b>ls -G</b> and displays the directories with colours. 
		<br>
		The correct alias for this
		would be defined as follows: <b>alias ls="ls -G"</b>
		<br>
		<h1>Details:</h1>
		You can list all aliases with the command <b>alias -p</b>
