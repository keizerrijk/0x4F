		<h2>0x4F Guides: Tech guides presented in a lightweight, clear and understandable manner.</h2>
		I created this site as a resource for those tired of searching for some help/guidance relating to technology, and finding themselves on a tracker and javascript filled mess of a website, with half the page covered in ads (if they weren't blocked) and the article being 30% filler nothing.
		<br><br>
		In parallel I aim to make the content on this site, packed with information, while remaining proverbially fat free. In addition this site will remain advertisement free, ad infinitum.   
		<br><br>
		If you have written a guide, and are interested in having it hosted here, please write to me at my email address: zoomzer@protonmail.com.
